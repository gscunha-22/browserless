# Changelog

All notable changes to this plugin will be documented here.

## 1.1.0

- Added a repository-wide ecosystem inventory with conclusions, capability
  boundaries, complementary tooling, and a prioritized roadmap.
- Added setup guidance for ChatGPT, Codex, Claude, and Claude Code.
- Added the portable `browserless-web-research` Agent Skill for tool routing,
  evidence handling, and safe browser interaction.
- Added `AGENTS.md` and `CLAUDE.md` so coding agents receive consistent
  repository guidance.
- Added dependency-free repository validation and a GitHub Actions quality
  gate for scripts, manifests, skill metadata, and internal links.
- Declared the Node.js development version and npm commands, and added a
  security policy for credentials and browser-session data.
- Clarified that the live MCP server, rather than a pinned package version, is
  authoritative for tool schemas.

## 1.0.0 — initial release

- Added the `.cursor-plugin/plugin.json` manifest so the repository installs as a Cursor plugin.
- Added the `browserless` MCP server pointing at `https://mcp.browserless.io/mcp` over streamable HTTP.
- Authenticates with OAuth: Cursor discovers the server's OAuth metadata, registers dynamically, and manages tokens itself. The plugin declares no credentials, and the API token remains documented for manual installs.
- Added `assets/logo.svg`: the Browserless mark on a padded dark tile.
- Added `scripts/verify-mcp.mjs` to check connectivity, tool discovery, and tool execution against the hosted server.
- Documented the two MCP resources the server exposes: `browserless://status` and `browserless://api-docs`.
- Corrected the documented tool set against `browserless-mcp` 1.30.0: 14 tools, not 9. `browserless_download` is no longer served; `browserless_skill`, `browserless_account`, `browserless_usage`, `browserless_logs`, `browserless_sessions`, and `browserless_profiles` were undocumented.
